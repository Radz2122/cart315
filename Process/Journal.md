# Game Analysis: Hades

Hades is an interesting game because of its dynamic combat system, which encourages experimentation through a mix of weapons and abilities, making each playthrough unique and engaging. The game's roguelike design, characterized by randomized levels and enemies, enhances replayability. This unpredictability keeps the gameplay fresh and encourages players to devise strategies based on their current resources. 

Hades also features a well-designed progression system that allows players to acquire permanent upgrades and unlocks, fostering a sense of ongoing improvement. To maintain balance, the level of difficulty escalates when players attain a specific number of upgrades. The game's narrative is seamlessly woven into the gameplay, with non-playable characters reacting to the player's progress and offering insights into the lore of the main character. However, Hades is not without its flaws. Some weapons and abilities lack balance, with certain ones being noticeably more powerful and others significantly weaker.

For future projects, some intriguing concepts to incorporate could include the randomization of abilities while still granting players autonomy in their gameplay style. This would necessitate a variety of weapons to accommodate different combat styles, such as close-range, long range, offensive, and defensive combat. Each weapon should also have upgrade options to ensure that players who favor a particular weapon can still enjoy a varied experience.


# Conceptualizing: Ideation process

## Initial brainstorm and problem statement:
How can we make a challenging puzzle game while keeping it engaging?
Puzzles-> layers-> steps->completion-> prize-> satisfaction-> solving-> challenge-> putting pieces together-> analyzing-> conclusion-> outcome

Challenge-> difficult-> clues-> constraints-> paths-> multiples ways to solve-> variety-> creativity-> loopholes-> hacks-> speedrun-> replayability

Engagement-> fun vs frustration-> trial and error-> loops

## Desing values: 
Challenge-> mental challenge

Decision-making-> in puzzles (limited chances), or chosing routes

## Keyword for class activity: Layers
Idea  1: Layers and language
Made up language in layers-> steps to learning-> complexity

In this game concept, players explore a multi-dimensional world. Each dimension is linked, but to move to a new one, players must decipher the meaning of a special symbol in their current area. Clues guide them to discover new words. The ultimate goal is to collect all symbols and their definitions to communicate with a threatening entity endangering their land. 

Idea 2: Layers and Lost
Labyrinth-> Trial and error-> repetitive-> challenge-> patience

In this game concept, players explore a massive shifting labyrinth. As they complete missions or solve puzzles, the paths change dynamically. Visual cues guide them, but the overall environment is dark and atmospheric, creating a sense of distortion and disorientation. 

Idea 3: Layers and Puzzles
Complexity-> steps to solving-> solving across different levels-> one big puzzle

In this game concept, players descend into a bottomless pit (an ancient crater) and encounter puzzles along their journey. But hereâ€™s the twist: some puzzles are interconnected, and changes made for one puzzle may impact another. As players progress, they uncover the story of a forgotten civilization that once inhabited the pit.
